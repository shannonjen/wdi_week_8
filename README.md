# Week 8: Testing
####Day 1: Intro to Testing
TDD, BDD, and Ruby with RSpec
####Day 2: Testing in Rails
Testing models and factories

## TDD Process

1. Write a test to validate a piece of code you are going to write, run it - it should fail

1. Write the minimum amount of code needed for the test to pass

1. Run the test, ensure it passes

1. Go back and refactor your code to make it as efficient as possible for the situation and cover any extra edge cases

1. Make sure your test still passes, modify the test itself or add a new test if a new edge case has been added

### BDD is a subset of TDD

## RSpec 

To install RSpec:

```bash
$ gem install rspec

```  

### describe, context, and it

#### describe block
The describe block 
ex. 

```ruby
describe "something" do

```

#### it block

#### context block

### expect().to


### :each, :all

### let
