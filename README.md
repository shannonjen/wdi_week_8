# WDI Novemner
## Week 8: Testing

### Day 1 

#### Lecture 1: Test Driven Development

To install RSpec:

```bash
$ gem install rspec

```

##### Our First Test

Basic Ex.

We would like to write a method that prints "Hello World" to terminal.   

TDD Process

1. Write a test to validate a piece of code you are going to write, run it - it should fail

1. Write the minimum amount of code needed for the test to pass

1. Run the test, ensure it passes

1. Go back and refactor your code to make it as efficient as possible for the situation and cover any extra edge cases

1. Make sure your test still passes, modify the test itself or add a new test if a new edge case has been added


### RSpec
[RSpec](http://rspec.info/)
[Getting Started](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/docs/gettingstarted)
[RSpec Core](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/frames)

rspec init command generates a .rspec file and a spec folder with a spec_helper.rb file.

```bash
$ rspec --init
```
